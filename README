DRIVE RW MON XFCE PLUGIN
Monitor current read and write speed of given disk in panel.

Why does this exists?
I found only 2 projects in this context, both had ugly code, but this was not the only problem.
The first one was using bars instead of showing the values in bytes.
The second one was bloated and unmaintained.

How to build?
1. Modify the macros on the top in driverwmon.c to match your preferences
2. Install build dependencies (assuming runtime deps are already installed)
- gcc
- make
- pkg-config
- libxfce4panel-2.0
3. CD to repo root
4. $ make
5. as root: $ make install
To uninstall: as root: $ make uninstall
